#Phishtank Analyzer

A complete enviroment for analysis of changing content on websites listed as phishing for a certain period of time. 
This was used for support the final paper on Software Engineering bachelor degreee. 

The whole enviroment is dockerized, thus, this experiment is made for easy replication. 

This enviroment was designed to run on a single machine, it was not designed for scaling.
